# In this project, we are going to determine:
# How much total net revenue you received from all of these sales?
# What product is retail product price more than twice the wholesale price?
# How much did the store make from food vs. computers vs. books? 
# Because your store is doing so well, you can negotiate a 30% discount on the wholesale price of goods. Calculate the new net revenue
